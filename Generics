1. with generics you can store just one type of data sets like arraylist.

2. Generics object can do autoboxing. Generics parameters must be reference type, can't be primitive type.
Generics can't define array.  Type variable/parameter(T) can't be instantiated.

3. Generic Type can't extend from Throwable, so we can't catch type variable(T) Exception.
(public class Problem< T > extends Exception) error!!!!

4. the type variable/parameter(T) member of a class can't be static
