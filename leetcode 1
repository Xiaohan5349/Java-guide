1. two sum, I use two loop to achieve this, ignore the collection class has contain method

36. valid sudoku. import a a set with its feature that doesn't allow duplicate elements, use three String to
represent row, col and cube.

26 remove duplicateds, use another variable index to represent how many kind of duplicate elements.

75 sort colors, use two int variable to count blue and red elements, reassign values to the array.

( we need to learn to import other variable to solve the problem.)
