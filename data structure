1. three iterators:
 Enumeration : old version of iterator, can only used on legacy collections(Vector, Hashtable), can just move forward, no way to remove.

 Iterator: The most universal iterator, the only iterator that can be used on all collections framework. It can remover element,
 however it can only move forward and no add and replace method.

 ListIterator: It can only be used on List, can move bi-dimensional and has add and replace method.
 ListIterator has no current element; its cursor position always lies between the element that would be returned by a call to p
 revious() and the element that would be returned by a call to next(). So without next() or Previous() method, you can't call
 set() method as the cursor has no element positon.

 Ps:  initially any iterator reference will point to the index just before the index of first element in a collection.
