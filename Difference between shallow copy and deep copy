1. ShallowCopy just copy the values of references in the class while the deep copy will copy the references.
etc:
A{
  B b;
}
B{
  int i = 100.
}
ShallowCopy of A will just copy the values of B, if you change the copyA.b, the A.b won't be changed, but if you change copyA.b.i, A.b.i will be changed.
Deepcopy will also copy a new object of B inside A.

2. marker interface: an empty interface.
