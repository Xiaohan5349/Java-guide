1. the most essential feature of polymorphism is the parent class/interface can refer to the object of
child class/interface-implemented class. In another word, the child class object can be used as a parent class object.
parent variable can refer to child class object directly, child variable need to cast type. we can use the instanceof to
judge if the type cast is feasible.

2. when child class and parent class define same-name method and  field. It will be totally different because of the work of
polymorphism.
        parent a = new child();    parent b = new parent();

method: when you call method, it will depends on the right side of the equal, that's say the method is determined by the type
of object. that the feature of polymorphism.

field: when you access the variable, it will depends on the left side of the equal, that's say the method is determined by the
type of reference variable. so the polymorphism doesn't work on field.
