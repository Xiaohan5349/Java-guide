primitive data type: int, short, long, float, double, char, byte, boolean, null
the difference between == and equals  when the equals method is from object, == is same with equals, they both compare if it's the same object, howerver from other class
this method may be overwriten, like the String.equals(). it's compare if they are same meaning that's say if the string are same. 
enum type are not primitive data type so all sepecific values are references from a specific object, same vlaue from same object. so the == and
equal are same.

each variable has a name(which represents the location in the memory) and data type, size and value(which represents the data stroed in the
memory). Each variable has its own scope.
