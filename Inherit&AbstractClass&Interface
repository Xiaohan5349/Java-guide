1. base class must call the constructor of parent class. It will automatic call the default constructor or
  the no-parameter constructor. If the parent class only have the constructor with parameter, you need to use
  super(parameter) to call it or it will report an error(the super() should be the first line of the constructor).

2. pulic       all variabl
  protected    current class, same package, child class
  defalut      current class and same package
  privat       current class
               scope

3.method between parent and child class:
extend: child class define a class that parent doesn't have
override: parent and child class define the same class
overload: parent and child class dfine same name class but different parameter
notice: when you override a method, its visibility should be equal or more than the method in base class, so the toString() must
be Overridden in public class
final and static method can't be Overridden.
Overridden method should throw less or equal exceptions than the original method.

4. any oject that join the calculate of a String will call implicit its toString() method

5. abstract class only define which method should exist and can't create object, it will extends a child class to
finish these methods and create new object.
A class have abstract mehod must be a abstract class, abstract class can have normal methods.

6. three kinds of abstract class:
(1) define a abstract method
(2)extend a abstract class and haven't implement the abstract methods completely.
(3)implement a interface and haven't implement all the abstract methods.

7. the class that implements the interface must implement all the methods that the parent and child interface define, then it
can be instantiated.

8. the constant defined in interface must be initialized.

9. a class can implement multi interfaces but inherit only one class.
